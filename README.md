# Project Description

This project involves analyzing data related to roller coasters from all over the world. The data was obtained from an open-source roller coaster database and includes information on over 1000 roller coasters, including their name, location, type, manufacturer, height, speed, and more. The aim of the project is to analyze the data and gain insights into the world of roller coasters, including the types of roller coasters that are most common, the most popular manufacturers, and the tallest and fastest roller coasters in the world.

# Libraries Used

1. `pandas`
2. `numpy`
3. `matplotlib.pylab`
4. `seaborn`

# Steps:

# Imports and Reading Data

* In this step, we import the necessary libraries and read the data from the CSV file.

# Data Understanding

* In this step, we look at the shape of the dataframe, the first and last five rows, and the datatypes of each column using the `head()`, `tail()`, and `dtypes()` functions.
* We also get a statistical summary of the dataframe using the `describe()` function.

# Data Cleaning

* In this step, we clean the data by removing unnecessary columns, renaming columns, and filling in missing values where necessary.
* We also convert columns containing non-numeric data to numeric data.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* In this step, we visualize the data using various plots such as bar charts, scatter plots, and box plots to gain insights into the data.
* We explore the most common types of roller coasters, the most popular manufacturers, and the tallest and fastest roller coasters in the world.

# Conclusion
The project involves analyzing data related to roller coasters from all over the world. We have analyzed the data and gained insights into the world of roller coasters, including the types of roller coasters that are most common, the most popular manufacturers, and the tallest and fastest roller coasters in the world. The results of the analysis can be used by theme park owners and roller coaster manufacturers to gain insights into the roller coaster industry and improve their offerings.
